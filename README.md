## Introduction

This course focuses on providing you the tools to take a quantum leap in your software development career. At the moment, creating a complex application may seem daunting to you. During this course, you'll learn about the tools to help you build complex software, in a way that the software is easy to understand and maintain. You'll feel more in control of the code you write, and you'll be able to make changes to your code without having to worry about breaking everything. When you're presented a software design problem, you'll have the tools to come up with a good solution that's quick to implement, isn't unnecessarily complicated, and will be easy to change.

Throughout the course, I'll use lots of examples, all written in Python. I'll assume you know the basics of Python, but I'll make sure to refresh some of the concepts for you along the way. The ideas that I'm covering are not specific to Python though. Data structures, classes and abstractions exist in most programming languages, and the principles and techniques I'll cover to improve the quality of your code are not specific to Python either.

I'm intentional about the code examples in this course. In particular, I find it important to use examples that reflect real life and could in principle be part of a real codebase. No "Animal" class hierarchy here, it's going to be practical stuff that you can apply immediately.

This is a course that requires your active participation. There is no magic pill unfortunately. If you want to see results, you need to apply the things I teach to your own code and gain experience with them,. To help you with this, I've included several quizzes, and many videos contain several code examples that I encourage you to download and modify to get a better grasp of the concepts.

I hope you're excited to get started. I look forward to walking alongside you on this journey you're about to take, so, let's dive in!

## Modules

### Module 1: Mastering The Tools

I am going to cover a few Python-specific things to be aware of, and I'll also talk about setting up your code environment and how to properly setup more complex 
software projects. Furthermore, I am going to show the basics in Python such as: types and type hints, data structures, (data)classes, and inheritance including abstract base classes and protocols. 

Though you may already know some of these things, I'd like to cover them in the course and specifically talk about them from a design perspective answering the following questions:

What are the consequences of choosing a particular data structure or inheritance hierarchy in terms of the software design?

**Topics Covered**

- Code enviroment
- Setup software projects
- Types and type hints
- Data structures
- Dataclasses
- Inheritance
  - Abstract classes
  - Protocols

### Module 2: The 7 Principles Of Modern Software Design

The second part is all about growing a particular mindset towards software development and design. At the basis of this mindset are the 7 Principles Of Modern Software Design. These principles are based on the many existing sets of principles out there, such as SOLID and GRASP, but adapted to the needs of the modern software engineer. The principles will help you recognize structures and patterns in what you want to achieve with your software design and will give you a great basis to start refactoring and improving your own code as well.

**Topics Covered**

- Favor Composition Over Inheritance
- High Cohesion
- Low Coupling
- Start With The Data
- Depend On Abstractions
- Separate Creation From Use
- Keep Things Simple

### Module 3: Being A Responsible Developer

Basics in Python: types and type hints, data structures, classes and dataclasses, and inheritance including abstract base classes and protocols. Though you may already know some of these things, I'd like to cover them in the course and specifically talk about them from a design perspective: what are the consequences of choosing a particular data structure or inheritance hierarchy in terms of the software design?

**Topics Covered**

- Mixins
- Dealing With Errors
- Setting Up A Complex Software Project
